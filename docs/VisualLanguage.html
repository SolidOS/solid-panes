    <h1>A Visual Language for the Solid Databrowser</h1>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      There has been a call for a Visual Language for Solid, in the style for
      example of the style of airbnb's blog on this.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that solid apps using the solid store will typically end up
      coming from many different places and using many different
      languages.&nbsp;&nbsp; The stores and their generic API are designed to be
      universal, so that any data at all can be put in Solid.&nbsp; So one would
      not want to mandate that all client apps use the same UI language
      everywhere forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there is a default app, the databrowser which ships as a sort of
      basic operating system on many solid servers.&nbsp; Its language is
      interesting for three reasons. Firstly, because it has&nbsp; been thought
      about: databrowser is a solid app, and so it is an example of the visual
      language which it ended up with; secondly because it is useful for people
      designing for the system to be able to design in the language, and thirdly
      because lots of people have suggested that the databrowser UI could be
      improved, this may give a focus for improving it! There are below as many
      questions asked and unanswered as answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the challenges in the UI of solid are that in the Solid world any
      app can have any data about anything -- from linked data attitude that
      anything can say anything about anything.&nbsp; Also as everything has a
      URI, anything can be linked to anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2>Panes</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;Something like person may start off with just having, say, contact
      information, about themselves, but then someone may add more information
      about their events, or messages,&nbsp; or tasks, and so on.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Panes are alternative views of a thing -- a think like a person or an
      event or a photo or a track.&nbsp; They are produced by different software
      modules, or apps.
    </p>
    <h3>Pane layout</h3>
    <p>
      Panes are rectangles -- HTML divs. They were originally designed to make
      the most powerful use possible of a large screen.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h4>Large screen</h4>
    <p>
      In solid panes, when used with a lot of screen real estate, a pane starts
      at the top left corner of the space, and works downward, but isn't afraid
      of of using the whole screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Panes do nest inside each other, but <strong>not</strong> like cute wooden
      window panes.&nbsp; An outer pane is free to put inner panes anywhere it
      likes to make sense and communicate well with the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      Panes should be tested on large screen sizes as well as medium and
      small.&nbsp; A user's journey might take them through some navigation
      steps to find after a while a picture, or map, or a chart, which really
      benefits from using up all the rest of the space.&nbsp; It can be very
      frustrating when you find such a resource, you have a large screen, but a
      developer at some point slapped a max width which suited their screen at
      the time.&nbsp; Don't let the push for mobile first leave the folks who
      delight in their huge screens facing a mobile-equivalents experience on
      them!
    </p>
    <h4>Small screen</h4>
    <p>
      On a small screen, by contrast, they should typically take the whole
      screen, but allow swipe navigation around a grid or a tree.&nbsp; There is
      (2018-11) no code, but some UI mockups have been done for the databrowser
      on mobile.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trick as ever is to re-use existing language
      the users will have come across where it exists and works. When looking
      for example at a attachment document in the materials of the meeting, you
      have to be able to vertically swipe through the pages of the document, so
      it is logical to horizontally swipe though the different documents, but to
      the left of the leftmost document instead a document being a navigation
      space at the top level of the meeting between between scheduling,
      location, attendees, program, materials, and notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A challenge in Solid is that things link together and contain each other
      in a very free way. Whereas a Meeting App might have a nav-bar with the
      top level, [scheduling,location, attendees, program, materials, notes], in
      Solid the meeting may be a property of the person who you had the meeting
      with, and the nav bar be full things to do with the person. Not
      insuperable problems, but things to think about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; While mobile first is an alternative in the works, the
      original "power user first" mantra.&nbsp;&nbsp; As it does so, it may
      invoke other panes to display things related to the main subject.
    </p>
    <h2>Edit anything - edit state</h2>
    <p>
      An attitude of the solid project has always been that collaboration
      between different people and groups is the goal. Therefore, wherever a
      user can view data they should be able, if authorized, to edit it too. To
      make it clear when this is possible, when it is happening, there are
      common colors for the different states of an input field
    </p>
    <table width="100%" border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Read, unedited</td>
          <td>Black on white</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Read, not editable</td>
          <td>Grey on white</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Edited, good syntax</td>
          <td>Green on white</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Edited, bad syntax</td>
          <td>Red on white</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Saving back</td>
          <td>Black on grey</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Error saving back</td>
          <td>Black on pink</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Saved back to the web</td>
          <td>Black on white</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>
      Examples of this are the fields in the form system, and the source editing
      pane.&nbsp;&nbsp; The users should get used to any black on white data
      being in sync with the web of data, and the system should always make sure
      to indicate with the colors above when it is not the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      When there are network errors saving user data, never through the data
      away!
    </p>
    <h3>Link to anything: Identity</h3>
    <p>
      In Solid, you can store connections between anything any anything.&nbsp;
      This doesn't always make sense, and may not always be useful, but we do
      have to have a UI language which&nbsp; allows this.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a desktop environment, drag and drop is more or less ubiquitous.&nbsp;
      Anything can be dragged, and many things can be dropped on to.&nbsp; You
      can drag a person into a group to add them to a group. You can drag a
      person, or a group, or both, into the Sharing control&nbsp; to give them
      access to something, dragging them around between the different roles
      until they have the right form of access. You can drag things from outside
      the solid world into a solid: a desktop file into a solid solid folder to
      upload it; you can drag a URI from the URL bar icon of a browser into the
      solid world to connect in the thing you were looking in the browser.&nbsp;
      You can drag things out of the solid world .. for example if you drag some
      item in a complex databrowser display onto the tab bar of the browser just
      past the tabs, it will open a new tab viewing that specific thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As anything is drag-able, it must be consistently clear what that thing
      is.&nbsp; One common widget used in many lists is a tree-part widget with
      an icon on the left, a&nbsp; label in the middle, and some control buttons
      ("delete this", "visit this", ...)in the right hand part.
    </p>
    <p>
      The icon is ideally set to a specific image of the object, like a mugshot
      of the person or logo of a company or project, otherwise set to an icon
      for the class: a generic icon for a person, a group of people, a document,
      and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where things are draggable in the desktop world, in the mobile world they
      need to have places to press on in various ways to capture their
      identity.&nbsp; The "Copy link" aka "Copy URI" functionality is very
      common UI language.&nbsp; Will the solid world be able to get away with
      just that, or will it need more "Mark this" where the marked thing is a
      second clipboard; or "Push this" to push things onto a stack?&nbsp; Should
      the things selected form an editable cache of interesting things which the
      user can pick from as the&nbsp; to all kinds of operations later? Should
      the user be able to scroll back through all the things they have every
      copied to the clipboard? Today's mobile clipboard is often not powerful
      enough, when you often need to copy the phone number and access code or
      flight number and reservation number at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>There is some design to be done here.</p>
    <h3>Button Color Language</h3>
    <p>We have tried to be consistent with colors:</p>
    <table width="100%" border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Green</td>
          <td>Add Data</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Red</td>
          <td>Remove Data</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Blue</td>
          <td>Commit, eg send a message</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Black &amp; White</td>
          <td>Change view, delete view</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <br />
    <p>
      One inspiration was the Mac OS X contact view at the time, where a quite
      readable view of someone's contact details was annotated with little green
      pluses and little red minuses which made it clear where things could be
      changed and how to change them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The color language is that anything which does not add or delete data, or
      commit the user to something, is monochrome.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have resisted
      the temptation to us pretty colored icons -- even the Rainbow icon used
      for sharing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may totally revisit this, and one day
      roll out a version with all the icons in really interesting colors
      representing the class of object or the domain in some way, but that is
      not the current language.&nbsp; We could also make it a user preference of
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discipline of making the databrowser navigation of folders and lists
      and people and meetings be essentially monochrome has meant that resources
      like pictures and icons
    </p>
    <h3>Icon shapes</h3>
    <p>
      Icons should be simple, a black drawing on a transparent background.&nbsp;
      All should be monochrome black on transparent exact for the few green, red
      or blue corresponding to the button color language above.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      We use<a href="https://thenounproject.com/"> the Noun project</a> as an
      excellent resource. We pay a fee so that there is no obligation to give
      attribution of the authorship, but still&nbsp; a way to extract all the
      authors and list them as credits with links back would be awesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Icons should use SVG, not PNG or JPEG or GIF.&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently they
      are all in a single module in solid-ui but ways of making that more
      modular are possible in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Icons are used for panes (views), actions, and object.&nbsp; The graphical
      form representing an object should be taken, in order or preference,&nbsp;
      from:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A foaf:icon for the thing</li>
      <li>
        Any other image for the thing itself from data, such as foaf:image,
        vcard:photo, etc, etc
      </li>
      <li>
        An icon corresponding to the class of the thing, like Person, Group,
        Meeting, etc
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Labels: use the ontology</h3>
    <p>
      The goal is of course to make everything as accessible as possible with
      people with different abilities, using different
      devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The internationalization goals are most easily
      met by using icons rather than text.&nbsp; Some people, however in fact
      prefer text.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data in the system is RDF data, and in RDF, classes (like
      <em>Person</em>) and properties (like <em>friend</em>) have URIs.&nbsp;
      There are files out there on the web with information about them, which
      includes a human-readable label for the property.
    </p>
    <p>
      The labels are often in English, but on a good day, in many
      languages.&nbsp; This means that if the UI generates&nbsp; up its labels
      from the ontology you get potentially internationalization for free, if
      there are alternative languages available in the ontology.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has the benefit&nbsp; that it scales quite well, in that effort put
      into translating the ontologies, which can possibly be crowd-sourced, pays
      off as an immediate benefit for anyone
    </p>
    <table width="100%" border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><em>Action</em></td>
          <td><em>Button label</em></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Create new instance of C</td>
          <td>&#10024;New (label(C))</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Create new thing related by property P</td>
          <td>"New" icon + label(P)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Visit thing(s) related by P</td>
          <td>label(P)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      In general a good rule when coding to to to try to involve introducing any
      text for the user which would have to be translated.&nbsp; Use a
      combination of icons and text looked up in the ontology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another idea is to make a composite icon out of the verb and the class, so
      "New Group" would be a compose icon of a small green plus (or star)
      superimposed on the icon for a group of people.&nbsp; This is quite common
      in desktop software, so the language will be understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Because you may want the ontology to be available offline, it may be a
      good idea to import a copy into code. How to do that is beyond the scope
      of this note)
    </p>
    <h3>Link to anything: Relationship</h3>
    <p>
      Demonstrating the relationship between two things typically involves a
      table with the relationship in the left and the object of it, or value, on
      the right. That <strong>labelled form field</strong> language is so
      ubiquitous in computer UI, we use all over.&nbsp; Having a user preference
      go flip it from left-right to right-left in locales where the user is
      reading everything right-left would be ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relationships also show up in
      <strong>column labels for tables</strong>.&nbsp; Just the same language
      applies as for a form field label.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is often easier to have a recognizable for icon for classes, like
      Person, Group, Adult, than for relationships like friend, child.&nbsp; So
      icons tend to less useful for expressing relationships than classes.
      However, when really there is only one main property linking thinks of
      class C to things of class D, then one use the icon for the class.&nbsp;
      If the only type of relationship a person can have an event, then the list
      of attendees can be given the person icon.
    </p>
    <h3>Link to anything; Potential relationship</h3>
    <p>
      More complex is the question of how to allow the user to see what
      potential relationships are available.&nbsp; As you drag in an object A to
      a drop target B, how do you know what relationship you are going to
      express?&nbsp; One way is for the drop zone mutate into a set of
      <strong>triage drop zones</strong>: Drop here to make this person and
      invitee, here an attendee, here an organizer.&nbsp; Another way is to just
      assume a default relationship, invitee, say, and then allow the user to
      edit that once they appear in the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are programs which do that -- but they are very bold about
      explaining to the user what is happening: large fonts in the labels.
      Fortunately the ugliness of the labels is temporary just until the user
      finishes the drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original tabulator code had a feature to allow any new data to be
      added to a form-like view, where the predicate was a pop-up choice of all
      the properties which logically were reasonable to use on the class of
      subject. Then the range of the property chosen would be looked up in the
      ontology, and the type of UI for the object of it would be selected from
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same choice in fact occurs when you are editing a form, and you add a
      new field.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3></h3>
    <h2>Making up panes: Widgets and Forms</h2>
    <p>
      Panes are the largest in the stack of UI systems.&nbsp; They are
      implemented in terms of lower level things. IN the case of the solid-panes
      solid-ui stack, the panes are implemented using widgets of various sizes ,
      and forms make out of widgets.
    </p>
    <p>
      A form is defined in the RDF data model. Typically a form is made by hand
      in Turtle, or it can be edited using the form-editing form.
    </p>
    <p><br /></p>
    <h2>Fonts, Font Size</h2>
    <h3>No Style Sheets</h3>
    <p>
      The classic way to make a web app is with an HTML markup file, a CSS style
      sheet&nbsp; and a JS script.&nbsp; When you build modular web apps with
      modularity in different levels./&nbsp; But CSS style sheets have the
      problem that they are global.&nbsp; Global in the sense if the document,
      that you can't attach them (2018) to a subtree, only the whole document.
      (Never mind shadow DOMs).&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem of distinguishing which
      parts of the style sheet should apply to which parts of the tree, which
      types of element, and the elements created by each widget, leads ttheo,
      in&nbsp; big UI frameworks, a huge complex language of classes which are
      attached to elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The databrowser does have a global style sheet, and it sets classes for
      some early panes, but now the goal is to reduce the dependency on it to
      zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h3>Font Size</h3>
    <p>
      Legibility is really important.&nbsp; If your over-cute font means that
      ageing people can't read it, drop it and go with something normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      - Where you don't need to specify something, inherit it from enclosing DOM
      elements.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Font, font size, color, background color,</p>
    <p>
      - Where a widget must have a certain style, inject it directly from the JS
      script.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is style module which has some JS variables for things like input
      element style so that can be shared through the code, rather than using
      global CSS which typically involves a lot of complexity and hard
      coordination between CSS writers and JS writers.
    </p>
